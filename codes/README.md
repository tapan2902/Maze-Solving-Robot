# Control Systems Maze Solver – LQR, MPC, PID, and SMC Implementation in MATLAB

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of four different controllers used for navigating a robot through maze environments. Each controller follows a path generated by a Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) planner. The project is designed to analyze and compare the performance of these controllers based on tracking accuracy, control effort, and overall path efficiency.

## Files Overview

| File Name              | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| `CSE_Project_LQR.m`    | Implements a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller for trajectory tracking. Linearizes the robot model and computes optimal gains using pole placement. |
| `CSE_Project_MPC.m`    | Implements a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy. Predicts future states and optimizes control inputs subject to constraints at each step. |
| `CSEproject_PID.m`     | Contains a classical PID controller setup with tuned parameters to minimize error between current and reference positions. |
| `CSEproject_SMC.m`     | Implements a Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) that ensures robust convergence to the reference trajectory despite disturbances. |
| `analysis.m`           | Aggregates results across all controllers for different maze sizes. Generates comparative plots (e.g., control steps, tracking error, total time). |
| `README.md`            | This file – provides project documentation and structure. |

## Project Summary

- **Robot Model**: Differential-drive unicycle robot with state \([x, y, \theta]\) and inputs \(v\), \(\omega\).
- **Path Planner**: Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) used to plan a path from start to goal through maze environments.
- **Environment**: Multiple maze sizes (e.g., 15x15 to 45x45), converted to binary occupancy grids for simulation.
- **Objective**: Evaluate and compare controller performance based on:
  - Control Steps
  - Mean Tracking Error
  - Total Path Length
  - Total Completion Time

## Performance Comparison

All results are generated using the `analysis.m` script. Key performance metrics are visualized in the `images/` directory (to be added).
